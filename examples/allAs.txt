; This is a example of a Turing machine that checks if all letters on the tape are "a"s only.
; Notation:
; Every state is defined like this: <Current state name> <current character> <to replace> <move on tape> <next state>
; The machine always starts at the state Start

State Start a a -> Start 
State Start # # - Success
State Start _ _ - Fail
